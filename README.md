# Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts the future stock prices from previous stock prices record / trend.

I have tried many ML models such as :

    >> Linear Regression
    >> Polynomial Regression
    >> Decision Tree Regression
    >> Random Forest Regression
    >> K Nearest Neighbors Regression
   
After comparing all models I have selected model with greatest accuracy score and this comes out to be Decision Tree Regressor.

Once model has been decided we dumped it with pickle library.

This project uses  :

    >> Python as Programming Language
    >> Jupyter Notebook as IDE for Model Selection
    >> Flask as Backened
    >> HTML, CSS, JS as Frontend
    
    
I have created a simple website for user to give date and receive predicted stock price without worrying about Code.

I have used following python libraries :

    >> Pandas
    >> NumPy
    >> Sklearn
    >> Matplotlib
    >> Seaborn
    >> datetime
    
    
 Hope you like the project. All suggestions will be welcomed.
